## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 23.9h | 167.8h | 671h | ~7486h* |
| Interactive human attention | 4.4h | 12.3h | 50.0h | 50.0h |
| Interactive AI generation | 12.0h | 52.2h | 130.5h | 130.5h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 0.9h | 5.8h | 5.8h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 5.6h | 42.6h | 311.7h | 895.4h |
| Additive observed work | 22.0h | 108.1h | 497.0h | 1,080.8h |
| Interactive sessions | 5 | 8 | 67 | 67 |
| Worker sessions | 215 | 1,116 | 4,595 | 7,512 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 43 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_Model savings are modest because ~96% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
