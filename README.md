## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 1h | 59.9h | 84.2h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 6.6h | 36.9h | 108.3h | 123.2h |
| AI worker hours | 43.4h | 177.3h | 378.9h | 435.4h |
| AI concurrency hours | 52.9h | 236.6h | 557.2h | 643.5h |
| Interactive sessions | 17 | 118 | 259 | 290 |
| Worker sessions | 30 | 162 | 521 | 687 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 35 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
