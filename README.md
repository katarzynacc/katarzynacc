## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 3.7h | 63.4h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 1.7h | 31.1h | 101.3h | 151.7h |
| AI worker hours | 33.3h | 183.7h | 512.0h | 612.8h |
| AI concurrency hours | 36.3h | 244.6h | 688.1h | 877.3h |
| Interactive sessions | 1 | 62 | 241 | 344 |
| Worker sessions | 31 | 180 | 524 | 861 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 42 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
