## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 17h | 4.7h | 63.4h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 4.2h | 41.7h | 110.2h | 149.9h |
| AI worker hours | 38.4h | 219.5h | 490.8h | 579.6h |
| AI concurrency hours | 45.5h | 295.2h | 679.4h | 841.1h |
| Interactive sessions | 11 | 89 | 255 | 343 |
| Worker sessions | 49 | 210 | 523 | 838 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 40 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
