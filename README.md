## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 0h | 24.2h | 439.9h | ~6910h* |
| Interactive human attention | 1.5h | 17.9h | 102.1h | 160.7h |
| Interactive AI generation | 2.7h | 19.2h | 87.1h | 129.9h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 5.5h | 14.1h | 43.7h | 45.0h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 37.3h | 299.0h | 717.5h | 837.6h |
| Additive observed work | 46.7h | 348.7h | 940.6h | 1,163.4h |
| Interactive sessions | 6 | 51 | 294 | 474 |
| Worker sessions | 239 | 1,392 | 4,342 | 6,609 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: stale. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 48 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

_Model savings are modest because ~96% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
