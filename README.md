## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 167.8h | 488.4h | ~7216h* |
| Interactive human attention | 0.7h | 22.4h | 116.1h | 208.7h |
| Interactive AI generation | 1.8h | 18.5h | 104.6h | 173.5h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 5.7h | 39.6h | 59.4h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 3.0h | 51.6h | 665.2h | 960.2h |
| Additive observed work | 5.4h | 97.4h | 914.2h | 1,387.3h |
| Interactive sessions | 4 | 14 | 258 | 535 |
| Worker sessions | 338 | 1,563 | 5,110 | 8,644 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 60 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

_10,831.7M total tokens processed. 96% cache hit rate._

_Model savings are modest because ~96% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
