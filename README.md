## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 59.9h | 84.2h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 6.2h | 36.0h | 108.6h | 125.1h |
| AI worker hours | 24.8h | 173.7h | 388.6h | 452.3h |
| AI concurrency hours | 33.8h | 231.3h | 565.0h | 662.8h |
| Interactive sessions | 14 | 112 | 248 | 291 |
| Worker sessions | 23 | 154 | 500 | 698 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 36 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
