## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 120.2h | 488.3h | ~7010h* |
| Interactive human attention | 2.6h | 25.0h | 100.3h | 169.8h |
| Interactive AI generation | 2.8h | 26.4h | 85.4h | 137.8h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 13.7h | 43.7h | 45.0h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 11.1h | 309.6h | 722.9h | 867.0h |
| Additive observed work | 16.5h | 373.4h | 942.5h | 1,209.8h |
| Interactive sessions | 11 | 68 | 296 | 492 |
| Worker sessions | 137 | 1,439 | 4,301 | 6,806 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 50 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
