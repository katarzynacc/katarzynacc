## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 83.2h | 490.7h | ~7297h* |
| Interactive human attention | 0.0h | 13.1h | 67.3h | 67.3h |
| Interactive AI generation | 0.3h | 51.1h | 187.8h | 187.8h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 2.9h | 8.8h | 8.8h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 2.0h | 39.5h | 249.4h | 948.7h |
| Additive observed work | 2.3h | 105.8h | 511.5h | 1,210.9h |
| Interactive sessions | 1 | 19 | 87 | 87 |
| Worker sessions | 229 | 1,399 | 5,302 | 9,133 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 51 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

_7,697.2M total tokens processed. 95.6% cache hit rate._

_$33,296.13 total saved ($22,633.70 caching + $10,662.43 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~95.6% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
