## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 3.7h | 63.4h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 7.4h | 32.3h | 104.5h | 157.4h |
| AI worker hours | 51.2h | 205.3h | 533.2h | 635.1h |
| AI concurrency hours | 62.3h | 256.1h | 714.3h | 907.7h |
| Interactive sessions | 4 | 56 | 240 | 347 |
| Worker sessions | 49 | 197 | 535 | 883 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 42 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
