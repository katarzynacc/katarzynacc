## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 3.7h | 63.4h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 5.9h | 32.7h | 103.1h | 155.9h |
| AI worker hours | 48.3h | 191.3h | 526.9h | 627.8h |
| AI concurrency hours | 57.0h | 253.6h | 705.9h | 898.0h |
| Interactive sessions | 4 | 58 | 241 | 347 |
| Worker sessions | 47 | 191 | 538 | 877 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 42 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
