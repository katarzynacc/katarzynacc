## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 55.2h | 141.8h | ~1,825h* |
| User AI session hours | 5.3h | 28.1h | 107.1h | 112.8h |
| AI worker hours | 16.5h | 155.4h | 329.5h | 373.1h |
| AI concurrency hours | 25.5h | 202.4h | 510.6h | 565.7h |
| Interactive sessions | 18 | 97 | 246 | 265 |
| Worker sessions | 24 | 151 | 545 | 650 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 34 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
