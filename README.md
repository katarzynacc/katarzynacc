## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 108.6h | 431.7h | ~7256h* |
| Interactive human attention | 1.9h | 18.5h | 58.8h | 85.8h |
| Interactive AI generation | 2.3h | 30.3h | 178.0h | 218.2h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.4h | 11.1h | 17.2h | 19.8h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 7.2h | 97.3h | 286.7h | 1057.1h |
| Additive observed work | 11.9h | 156.5h | 539.1h | 1,378.5h |
| Interactive sessions | 2 | 17 | 66 | 104 |
| Worker sessions | 261 | 1,445 | 5,171 | 10,718 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 59 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_Model savings are modest because ~95.7% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
