## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 55.2h | 141.8h | ~1,825h* |
| User AI session hours | 6.0h | 27.9h | 108.1h | 112.6h |
| AI worker hours | 14.8h | 150.8h | 325.6h | 368.5h |
| AI concurrency hours | 24.8h | 197.4h | 507.7h | 560.8h |
| Interactive sessions | 18 | 96 | 246 | 264 |
| Worker sessions | 20 | 146 | 543 | 645 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 33 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
