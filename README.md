## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 6h | 4.7h | 84.2h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 7.7h | 41.7h | 109.6h | 138.8h |
| AI worker hours | 25.7h | 163.8h | 409.7h | 488.6h |
| AI concurrency hours | 37.2h | 239.6h | 597.1h | 731.3h |
| Interactive sessions | 19 | 108 | 252 | 317 |
| Worker sessions | 42 | 175 | 483 | 760 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 38 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
