## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 3.7h | 63.4h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 0.0h | 32.4h | 100.9h | 149.9h |
| AI worker hours | 3.7h | 188.4h | 484.1h | 583.3h |
| AI concurrency hours | 3.7h | 250.1h | 659.5h | 844.8h |
| Interactive sessions | 0 | 67 | 241 | 343 |
| Worker sessions | 5 | 181 | 511 | 840 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 41 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
