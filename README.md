## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 23.9h | 145.4h | 488.2h | ~7055h* |
| Interactive human attention | 6.2h | 28.2h | 104.2h | 181.6h |
| Interactive AI generation | 5.0h | 30.4h | 91.2h | 150.0h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 1.5h | 12.6h | 46.1h | 47.4h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 10.3h | 183.6h | 744.1h | 895.8h |
| Additive observed work | 22.0h | 252.6h | 974.6h | 1,263.8h |
| Interactive sessions | 23 | 74 | 308 | 519 |
| Worker sessions | 147 | 956 | 4,455 | 7,040 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 52 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
