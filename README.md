## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 21h | 59.9h | 84.2h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 7.0h | 35.9h | 108.2h | 123.7h |
| AI worker hours | 44.5h | 174.8h | 379.8h | 436.5h |
| AI concurrency hours | 54.7h | 232.8h | 557.3h | 645.2h |
| Interactive sessions | 16 | 117 | 256 | 291 |
| Worker sessions | 31 | 157 | 519 | 688 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 35 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
