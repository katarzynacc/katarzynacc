## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 4.7h | 63.4h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 7.1h | 41.8h | 110.1h | 145.7h |
| AI worker hours | 59.1h | 195.7h | 456.8h | 541.8h |
| AI concurrency hours | 71.3h | 271.8h | 645.1h | 796.2h |
| Interactive sessions | 17 | 97 | 254 | 333 |
| Worker sessions | 61 | 185 | 506 | 803 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 39 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
