## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 23.9h | 116.5h | 457.9h | ~7293h* |
| Interactive human attention | 0.6h | 12.9h | 69.0h | 80.2h |
| Interactive AI generation | 1.8h | 23.6h | 188.6h | 211.1h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 1.4h | 8.8h | 17.3h | 17.5h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 8.9h | 85.6h | 308.9h | 1031.5h |
| Additive observed work | 12.7h | 130.6h | 581.9h | 1,338.3h |
| Interactive sessions | 5 | 15 | 88 | 101 |
| Worker sessions | 317 | 1,391 | 5,417 | 10,203 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 56 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_Model savings are modest because ~95.8% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
