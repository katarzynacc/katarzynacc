## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 0h | 5.9h | 509.3h | ~7333h* |
| Interactive human attention | 0.6h | 21.7h | 67.3h | 67.3h |
| Interactive AI generation | 2.4h | 69.1h | 187.6h | 187.6h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 2.9h | 8.8h | 8.8h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 7.6h | 56.0h | 268.1h | 945.8h |
| Additive observed work | 10.6h | 148.9h | 529.9h | 1,207.7h |
| Interactive sessions | 2 | 24 | 86 | 86 |
| Worker sessions | 245 | 1,559 | 5,221 | 8,856 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 49 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

| Model | Requests | Input | Output | Cache read | API Cost | Cache savings | Model savings |

_8,142.1M total tokens processed. 95.6% cache hit rate._

_$35,202.71 total saved ($23,873.64 caching + $11,329.06 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~95.6% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
