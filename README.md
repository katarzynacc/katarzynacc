## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 55.2h | 141.8h | ~1,825h* |
| User AI session hours | 5.4h | 29.5h | 107.0h | 114.1h |
| AI worker hours | 26.8h | 171.8h | 339.2h | 389.5h |
| AI concurrency hours | 34.6h | 220.9h | 520.0h | 584.3h |
| Interactive sessions | 12 | 101 | 250 | 269 |
| Worker sessions | 22 | 154 | 522 | 653 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 34 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
