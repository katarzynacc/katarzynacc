## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 59.9h | 84.2h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 5.6h | 37.2h | 108.7h | 126.3h |
| AI worker hours | 15.6h | 163.0h | 379.3h | 444.8h |
| AI concurrency hours | 35.2h | 233.4h | 566.9h | 668.2h |
| Interactive sessions | 12 | 115 | 249 | 294 |
| Worker sessions | 22 | 160 | 500 | 705 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 36 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
