## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 55.2h | 141.8h | ~1,825h* |
| User AI session hours | 5.0h | 27.0h | 107.7h | 111.7h |
| AI worker hours | 16.6h | 146.7h | 321.6h | 364.4h |
| AI concurrency hours | 25.2h | 191.9h | 503.2h | 555.4h |
| Interactive sessions | 17 | 94 | 244 | 262 |
| Worker sessions | 16 | 137 | 535 | 636 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 33 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
