## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 59.9h | 84.2h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 6.0h | 39.3h | 111.3h | 131.1h |
| AI worker hours | 17.3h | 152.4h | 385.4h | 454.8h |
| AI concurrency hours | 26.6h | 225.5h | 574.8h | 685.8h |
| Interactive sessions | 7 | 107 | 247 | 298 |
| Worker sessions | 20 | 147 | 489 | 713 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 37 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
