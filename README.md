## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 23.9h | 128.1h | 458h | ~7280h* |
| Interactive human attention | 6.0h | 12.9h | 68.7h | 79.5h |
| Interactive AI generation | 9.5h | 24.1h | 195.7h | 209.3h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 6.1h | 7.4h | 16.0h | 16.2h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 40.6h | 84.3h | 303.3h | 1022.6h |
| Additive observed work | 62.2h | 128.5h | 581.9h | 1,325.6h |
| Interactive sessions | 3 | 13 | 87 | 97 |
| Worker sessions | 463 | 1,329 | 5,316 | 9,940 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 55 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_Model savings are modest because ~95.9% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
