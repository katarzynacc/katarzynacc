## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 5.8h | 59.7h | 563h | ~7306h* |
| Interactive human attention | 3.9h | 22.9h | 63.3h | 63.3h |
| Interactive AI generation | 14.1h | 72.8h | 173.3h | 173.3h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.7h | 1.8h | 7.0h | 7.0h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 3.1h | 56.6h | 279.4h | 931.9h |
| Additive observed work | 21.6h | 153.9h | 521.9h | 1,174.5h |
| Interactive sessions | 15 | 25 | 85 | 85 |
| Worker sessions | 351 | 1,665 | 5,180 | 8,552 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 47 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

| Model | Requests | Input | Output | Cache read | API Cost | Cache savings | Model savings |

_8,499.8M total tokens processed. 95.6% cache hit rate._

_$36,754.74 total saved ($24,948.67 caching + $11,806.07 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~95.6% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
