## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 23.9h | 167.8h | 541.1h | ~7318h* |
| Interactive human attention | 3.3h | 23.4h | 26.9h | 143.1h |
| Interactive AI generation | 3.3h | 35.1h | 40.2h | 122.7h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.8h | 2.7h | 2.7h | 27.4h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 17.7h | 68.5h | 658.8h | 1095.0h |
| Additive observed work | 25.1h | 128.8h | 727.7h | 1,381.7h |
| Interactive sessions | 2 | 36 | 38 | 398 |
| Worker sessions | 307 | 1,564 | 4,880 | 9,413 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 66 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
