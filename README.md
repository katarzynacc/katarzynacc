## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 21h | 4.7h | 84.2h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 7.5h | 42.5h | 110.7h | 145.6h |
| AI worker hours | 49.1h | 183.0h | 445.7h | 525.4h |
| AI concurrency hours | 62.4h | 259.9h | 634.9h | 779.3h |
| Interactive sessions | 21 | 98 | 256 | 333 |
| Worker sessions | 54 | 172 | 507 | 788 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 39 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
