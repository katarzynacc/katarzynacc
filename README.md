## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 59.9h | 84.2h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 6.0h | 39.2h | 110.0h | 131.1h |
| AI worker hours | 20.1h | 155.6h | 390.1h | 459.7h |
| AI concurrency hours | 29.5h | 228.4h | 577.6h | 690.8h |
| Interactive sessions | 7 | 104 | 244 | 298 |
| Worker sessions | 25 | 151 | 489 | 718 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 37 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
