## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 4.7h | 59.9h | 84.2h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 6.2h | 35.8h | 107.3h | 121.8h |
| AI worker hours | 39.5h | 184.9h | 372.9h | 429.3h |
| AI concurrency hours | 47.8h | 241.7h | 549.2h | 634.7h |
| Interactive sessions | 16 | 114 | 255 | 286 |
| Worker sessions | 31 | 163 | 518 | 684 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 35 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
