## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 167.8h | 670.9h | ~7498h* |
| Interactive human attention | 4.2h | 16.5h | 54.2h | 54.2h |
| Interactive AI generation | 6.2h | 58.4h | 136.7h | 136.7h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 0.9h | 5.8h | 5.8h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 13.9h | 56.5h | 300.5h | 909.3h |
| Additive observed work | 24.3h | 132.4h | 496.3h | 1,105.1h |
| Interactive sessions | 2 | 9 | 68 | 68 |
| Worker sessions | 289 | 1,381 | 4,722 | 7,777 |

_Screen time from screen-time-history:daily-observations; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 44 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

| Model | Requests | Input | Output | Cache read | API Cost | Cache savings | Model savings |

_8,617.2M total tokens processed. 95.9% cache hit rate._

_$38,104.87 total saved ($26,098.59 caching + $12,006.28 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~95.9% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
