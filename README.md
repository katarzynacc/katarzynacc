## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 167.8h | 488.4h | ~7119h* |
| Interactive human attention | 6.0h | 34.1h | 113.5h | 194.7h |
| Interactive AI generation | 2.0h | 29.1h | 98.6h | 159.0h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 1.1h | 10.3h | 54.0h | 55.3h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 9.9h | 89.5h | 708.5h | 927.1h |
| Additive observed work | 18.9h | 158.8h | 960.7h | 1,322.2h |
| Interactive sessions | 4 | 54 | 295 | 526 |
| Worker sessions | 451 | 1,161 | 4,629 | 7,646 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 55 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_Model savings are modest because ~96.2% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
