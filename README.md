## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 0h | 143.9h | 647h | ~7498h* |
| Interactive human attention | 2.8h | 19.2h | 57.0h | 57.0h |
| Interactive AI generation | 2.0h | 56.2h | 138.7h | 138.7h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 0.9h | 5.8h | 5.8h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 10.6h | 58.1h | 295.9h | 919.9h |
| Additive observed work | 15.5h | 134.4h | 496.5h | 1,120.5h |
| Interactive sessions | 3 | 12 | 71 | 71 |
| Worker sessions | 439 | 1,664 | 5,013 | 8,175 |

_Screen time from screen-time-history:daily-observations; collection status: ok, stale. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 45 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

| Model | Requests | Input | Output | Cache read | API Cost | Cache savings | Model savings |

_8,379.9M total tokens processed. 95.8% cache hit rate._

_$36,776.30 total saved ($25,133.89 caching + $11,642.42 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~95.8% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
