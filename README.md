## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 55.2h | 141.8h | ~1,825h* |
| User AI session hours | 3.1h | 24.6h | 106.5h | 108.9h |
| AI worker hours | 15.9h | 145.3h | 320.8h | 363.0h |
| AI concurrency hours | 22.3h | 187.4h | 501.1h | 550.3h |
| Interactive sessions | 20 | 92 | 243 | 259 |
| Worker sessions | 15 | 135 | 537 | 634 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 33 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
