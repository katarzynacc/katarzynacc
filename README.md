## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 167.8h | 488.5h | ~7252h* |
| Interactive human attention | 0.4h | 11.2h | 18.4h | 127.4h |
| Interactive AI generation | 8.9h | 22.5h | 25.7h | 105.1h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 0.2h | 1.4h | 25.0h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 3.4h | 44.8h | 703.3h | 1047.2h |
| Additive observed work | 12.7h | 78.6h | 748.2h | 1,298.8h |
| Interactive sessions | 6 | 16 | 34 | 376 |
| Worker sessions | 192 | 1,182 | 4,642 | 8,659 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 63 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_10,668.0M total tokens processed. 96.1% cache hit rate._

_Model savings are modest because ~96.1% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
