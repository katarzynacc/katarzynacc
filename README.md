## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 2.9h | 128.2h | 458h | ~7267h* |
| Interactive human attention | 3.0h | 10.3h | 67.9h | 73.6h |
| Interactive AI generation | 5.5h | 26.5h | 189.4h | 199.8h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 1.3h | 3.1h | 10.0h | 10.1h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 21.6h | 50.1h | 273.7h | 982.0h |
| Additive observed work | 31.1h | 89.0h | 539.1h | 1,263.5h |
| Interactive sessions | 6 | 13 | 88 | 95 |
| Worker sessions | 328 | 1,225 | 5,238 | 9,632 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 54 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_Model savings are modest because ~95.9% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
