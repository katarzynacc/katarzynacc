## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 3.7h | 63.4h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 1.5h | 32.6h | 101.1h | 151.5h |
| AI worker hours | 27.5h | 179.8h | 506.4h | 607.2h |
| AI concurrency hours | 30.1h | 242.2h | 682.0h | 871.2h |
| Interactive sessions | 1 | 67 | 241 | 344 |
| Worker sessions | 22 | 179 | 516 | 853 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 42 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
