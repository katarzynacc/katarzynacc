## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 167.9h | 671.2h | ~7474h* |
| Interactive human attention | 4.3h | 7.9h | 45.6h | 45.6h |
| Interactive AI generation | 13.8h | 40.2h | 118.5h | 118.5h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.6h | 0.9h | 5.8h | 5.8h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 7.4h | 37.0h | 319.9h | 889.8h |
| Additive observed work | 26.2h | 86.1h | 488.9h | 1,058.8h |
| Interactive sessions | 4 | 5 | 64 | 64 |
| Worker sessions | 283 | 955 | 4,540 | 7,351 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 42 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_Model savings are modest because ~96% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
