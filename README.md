## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 4.7h | 59.9h | 84.2h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 6.4h | 35.3h | 107.3h | 120.6h |
| AI worker hours | 39.5h | 197.7h | 372.8h | 429.2h |
| AI concurrency hours | 48.3h | 253.8h | 549.8h | 632.9h |
| Interactive sessions | 14 | 114 | 254 | 283 |
| Worker sessions | 32 | 178 | 524 | 684 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 35 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
