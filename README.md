## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 0h | 119.9h | 623.1h | ~7498h* |
| Interactive human attention | 2.4h | 19.0h | 59.4h | 59.4h |
| Interactive AI generation | 20.5h | 60.1h | 159.2h | 159.2h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.5h | 1.1h | 6.3h | 6.3h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 8.9h | 54.1h | 287.1h | 928.8h |
| Additive observed work | 32.3h | 134.3h | 511.2h | 1,152.9h |
| Interactive sessions | 2 | 11 | 71 | 71 |
| Worker sessions | 321 | 1,526 | 5,000 | 8,268 |

_Screen time from screen-time-history:daily-observations; collection status: stale. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 46 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

| Model | Requests | Input | Output | Cache read | API Cost | Cache savings | Model savings |

_8,305.4M total tokens processed. 95.8% cache hit rate._

_$36,331.98 total saved ($24,771.44 caching + $11,560.54 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~95.8% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
