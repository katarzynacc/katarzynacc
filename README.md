## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 22.6h | 60.1h | 508.9h | ~7002h* |
| Interactive human attention | 2.0h | 27.2h | 101.9h | 153.5h |
| Interactive AI generation | 4.1h | 20.3h | 81.2h | 119.6h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 2.4h | 6.9h | 33.6h | 34.8h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 97.8h | 281.4h | 605.1h | 712.1h |
| Additive observed work | 106.1h | 334.4h | 813.0h | 1,011.1h |
| Interactive sessions | 22 | 81 | 308 | 454 |
| Worker sessions | 409 | 1,659 | 4,294 | 6,179 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 45 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
