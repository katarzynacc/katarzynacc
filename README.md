## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 23.9h | 167.6h | 599.4h | ~7378h* |
| Interactive human attention | 1.5h | 26.5h | 37.7h | 153.8h |
| Interactive AI generation | 7.0h | 55.7h | 78.2h | 160.8h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.1h | 4.7h | 4.9h | 29.7h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 22.9h | 130.2h | 610.4h | 1177.4h |
| Additive observed work | 31.5h | 216.3h | 730.4h | 1,515.1h |
| Interactive sessions | 9 | 46 | 59 | 419 |
| Worker sessions | 218 | 1,610 | 4,897 | 10,238 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 70 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_Model savings are modest because ~96.3% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
