## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 0h | 36.7h | 463.9h | ~6910h* |
| Interactive human attention | 3.4h | 19.7h | 106.9h | 159.2h |
| Interactive AI generation | 4.8h | 19.5h | 88.3h | 127.2h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 1.0h | 10.3h | 38.3h | 39.5h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 58.9h | 300.3h | 688.7h | 800.4h |
| Additive observed work | 68.1h | 348.4h | 912.7h | 1,116.7h |
| Interactive sessions | 15 | 57 | 322 | 469 |
| Worker sessions | 241 | 1,443 | 4,423 | 6,420 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 47 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_Model savings are modest because ~96% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
