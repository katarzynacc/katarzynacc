## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 59.9h | 84.2h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 5.4h | 37.9h | 109.5h | 127.2h |
| AI worker hours | 17.0h | 164.2h | 380.8h | 446.4h |
| AI concurrency hours | 36.3h | 235.4h | 569.5h | 670.9h |
| Interactive sessions | 10 | 114 | 248 | 294 |
| Worker sessions | 23 | 161 | 501 | 706 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 36 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
