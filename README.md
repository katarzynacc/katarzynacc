## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 23.9h | 167.7h | 648.7h | ~7420h* |
| Interactive human attention | 0.1h | 10.9h | 37.8h | 37.8h |
| Interactive AI generation | 4.3h | 42.4h | 82.5h | 82.5h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 2.3h | 4.9h | 4.9h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 9.1h | 91.4h | 450.2h | 861.8h |
| Additive observed work | 13.4h | 146.8h | 574.5h | 986.1h |
| Interactive sessions | 2 | 23 | 61 | 61 |
| Worker sessions | 290 | 1,139 | 4,385 | 6,686 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 38 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_$49,781.36 total saved ($34,834.56 caching + $14,946.80 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~96.3% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
