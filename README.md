## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 59.9h | 84.2h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 6.2h | 36.0h | 108.6h | 125.1h |
| AI worker hours | 28.3h | 174.7h | 388.8h | 452.1h |
| AI concurrency hours | 37.4h | 232.4h | 565.3h | 662.6h |
| Interactive sessions | 14 | 112 | 248 | 291 |
| Worker sessions | 30 | 156 | 503 | 698 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 36 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
