## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 3h | 7.7h | 87.2h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 7.5h | 41.8h | 109.4h | 138.6h |
| AI worker hours | 20.3h | 155.7h | 407.6h | 480.0h |
| AI concurrency hours | 31.3h | 231.3h | 594.4h | 722.1h |
| Interactive sessions | 18 | 107 | 251 | 316 |
| Worker sessions | 26 | 159 | 497 | 742 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 38 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
