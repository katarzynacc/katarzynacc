## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 10.7h | 65.9h | 90.2h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 4.8h | 33.9h | 106.9h | 118.9h |
| AI worker hours | 32.9h | 176.9h | 353.6h | 408.4h |
| AI concurrency hours | 39.7h | 231.3h | 530.5h | 609.9h |
| Interactive sessions | 9 | 109 | 251 | 278 |
| Worker sessions | 15 | 159 | 516 | 665 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 35 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
