## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 23.9h | 167.6h | 575.5h | ~7349h* |
| Interactive human attention | 3.3h | 25.4h | 36.2h | 152.3h |
| Interactive AI generation | 19.2h | 57.7h | 71.3h | 153.8h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 1.6h | 4.6h | 4.8h | 29.6h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 40.9h | 110.6h | 599.0h | 1154.5h |
| Additive observed work | 64.9h | 197.5h | 710.4h | 1,483.6h |
| Interactive sessions | 5 | 40 | 50 | 410 |
| Worker sessions | 252 | 1,579 | 4,773 | 10,045 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 69 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_Model savings are modest because ~96.2% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
