## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 23.9h | 144.1h | 488.3h | ~7032h* |
| Interactive human attention | 5.6h | 24.0h | 103.6h | 175.4h |
| Interactive AI generation | 7.1h | 29.5h | 91.4h | 144.9h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 1.0h | 13.5h | 44.7h | 45.9h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 18.2h | 271.1h | 740.2h | 885.5h |
| Additive observed work | 31.7h | 336.7h | 969.8h | 1,241.7h |
| Interactive sessions | 21 | 76 | 308 | 508 |
| Worker sessions | 211 | 1,212 | 4,443 | 6,975 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 51 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
