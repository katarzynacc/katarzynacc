## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 167.9h | 671.1h | ~7461h* |
| Interactive human attention | 0.9h | 5.1h | 41.3h | 41.3h |
| Interactive AI generation | 4.1h | 33.3h | 104.6h | 104.6h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.1h | 0.5h | 5.3h | 5.3h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 7.1h | 52.5h | 335.8h | 882.4h |
| Additive observed work | 12.1h | 91.5h | 486.0h | 1,032.6h |
| Interactive sessions | 2 | 12 | 62 | 62 |
| Worker sessions | 307 | 1,016 | 4,507 | 7,194 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 41 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_$43,147.16 total saved ($30,730.33 caching + $12,416.83 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~96.1% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
