## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 167.9h | 488.4h | ~7179h* |
| Interactive human attention | 3.3h | 29.0h | 118.9h | 204.5h |
| Interactive AI generation | 4.6h | 21.3h | 103.1h | 166.3h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 13.5h | 51.1h | 59.4h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 8.0h | 69.6h | 698.7h | 955.1h |
| Additive observed work | 15.9h | 129.0h | 958.1h | 1,370.7h |
| Interactive sessions | 1 | 33 | 282 | 529 |
| Worker sessions | 289 | 1,294 | 4,924 | 8,187 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 58 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_Model savings are modest because ~96.2% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
