## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 4.7h | 63.4h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 0.0h | 33.5h | 103.0h | 149.9h |
| AI worker hours | 0.0h | 188.3h | 480.7h | 579.6h |
| AI concurrency hours | 0.0h | 251.6h | 658.4h | 841.1h |
| Interactive sessions | 0 | 72 | 242 | 343 |
| Worker sessions | 0 | 184 | 511 | 838 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 40 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
