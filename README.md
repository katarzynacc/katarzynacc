## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 141.5h | 431.8h | ~7293h* |
| Interactive human attention | 0.4h | 10.3h | 53.7h | 89.9h |
| Interactive AI generation | 6.8h | 21.0h | 159.0h | 230.3h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 1.3h | 11.0h | 22.4h | 27.2h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 16.6h | 77.8h | 270.5h | 1100.3h |
| Additive observed work | 25.1h | 119.7h | 504.1h | 1,445.2h |
| Interactive sessions | 8 | 16 | 62 | 112 |
| Worker sessions | 238 | 1,456 | 5,159 | 11,337 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 62 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_Model savings are modest because ~95.5% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
