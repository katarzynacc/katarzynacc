## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 2h | 6.7h | 86.2h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 7.5h | 41.9h | 109.4h | 138.6h |
| AI worker hours | 20.0h | 154.5h | 407.9h | 478.2h |
| AI concurrency hours | 30.9h | 230.2h | 594.5h | 720.2h |
| Interactive sessions | 18 | 108 | 252 | 316 |
| Worker sessions | 22 | 155 | 498 | 737 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 38 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
