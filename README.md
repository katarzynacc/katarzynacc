## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 167.8h | 564.6h | ~7334h* |
| Interactive human attention | 3.4h | 26.1h | 30.3h | 146.5h |
| Interactive AI generation | 4.6h | 37.9h | 44.8h | 127.3h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.2h | 2.8h | 2.8h | 27.6h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 8.7h | 74.3h | 644.8h | 1103.7h |
| Additive observed work | 16.9h | 140.3h | 722.0h | 1,398.7h |
| Interactive sessions | 5 | 38 | 43 | 403 |
| Worker sessions | 254 | 1,588 | 4,941 | 9,645 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 67 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
