## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 7h | 3.7h | 63.4h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 6.3h | 30.9h | 104.8h | 158.0h |
| AI worker hours | 96.1h | 265.4h | 605.4h | 711.1h |
| AI concurrency hours | 105.8h | 315.5h | 787.5h | 985.3h |
| Interactive sessions | 7 | 58 | 243 | 351 |
| Worker sessions | 56 | 213 | 546 | 915 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 43 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
