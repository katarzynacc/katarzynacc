## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 4.7h | 59.9h | 84.2h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 5.6h | 34.7h | 107.6h | 119.7h |
| AI worker hours | 38.7h | 196.5h | 371.7h | 428.1h |
| AI concurrency hours | 46.4h | 251.9h | 549.0h | 630.6h |
| Interactive sessions | 11 | 111 | 252 | 280 |
| Worker sessions | 29 | 174 | 520 | 680 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 35 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
