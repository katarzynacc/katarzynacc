## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 167.7h | 671.1h | ~7434h* |
| Interactive human attention | 2.6h | 10.1h | 40.4h | 40.4h |
| Interactive AI generation | 16.6h | 54.4h | 99.1h | 99.1h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.3h | 2.4h | 5.2h | 5.2h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 12.9h | 95.6h | 431.4h | 874.7h |
| Additive observed work | 32.4h | 162.3h | 575.2h | 1,018.6h |
| Interactive sessions | 2 | 20 | 61 | 61 |
| Worker sessions | 261 | 1,038 | 4,377 | 6,772 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 39 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_$48,797.22 total saved ($34,267.75 caching + $14,529.47 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~96.3% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
