## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 23h | 59.9h | 84.2h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 7.5h | 37.4h | 108.9h | 125.1h |
| AI worker hours | 44.7h | 176.6h | 384.2h | 441.4h |
| AI concurrency hours | 55.4h | 236.3h | 561.7h | 651.9h |
| Interactive sessions | 15 | 116 | 251 | 291 |
| Worker sessions | 30 | 154 | 516 | 689 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 35 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
