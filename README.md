## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 6h | 10.7h | 69.4h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 3.5h | 40.7h | 109.3h | 147.4h |
| AI worker hours | 42.6h | 211.9h | 474.8h | 560.3h |
| AI concurrency hours | 49.9h | 287.2h | 662.4h | 818.0h |
| Interactive sessions | 15 | 93 | 254 | 339 |
| Worker sessions | 56 | 202 | 523 | 822 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 39 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
