## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 12.3h | 131.1h | 479.1h | ~7323h* |
| Interactive human attention | 3.3h | 11.2h | 66.4h | 70.6h |
| Interactive AI generation | 6.4h | 35.1h | 187.5h | 194.3h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 2.5h | 8.8h | 8.8h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 0.6h | 31.5h | 255.5h | 960.4h |
| Additive observed work | 10.2h | 79.5h | 516.4h | 1,232.3h |
| Interactive sessions | 7 | 24 | 89 | 94 |
| Worker sessions | 192 | 1,266 | 5,252 | 9,467 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 53 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_Model savings are modest because ~95.8% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
