## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 4.7h | 63.4h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 5.5h | 41.4h | 110.0h | 146.3h |
| AI worker hours | 51.1h | 203.0h | 464.6h | 549.9h |
| AI concurrency hours | 62.1h | 279.1h | 653.1h | 806.3h |
| Interactive sessions | 16 | 96 | 250 | 335 |
| Worker sessions | 54 | 196 | 516 | 815 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 39 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
