## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 9h | 3.7h | 63.4h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 6.4h | 31.0h | 105.5h | 158.7h |
| AI worker hours | 98.7h | 270.3h | 611.8h | 717.5h |
| AI concurrency hours | 108.2h | 319.7h | 794.9h | 992.7h |
| Interactive sessions | 8 | 59 | 244 | 352 |
| Worker sessions | 54 | 213 | 544 | 918 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 43 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
