## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 1.6h | 61.2h | 486.5h | ~6910h* |
| Interactive human attention | 2.3h | 23.7h | 104.2h | 155.7h |
| Interactive AI generation | 2.8h | 20.5h | 84.0h | 122.4h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 3.6h | 9.6h | 37.2h | 38.4h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 29.4h | 290.7h | 632.7h | 741.5h |
| Additive observed work | 37.5h | 343.0h | 848.7h | 1,048.6h |
| Interactive sessions | 11 | 64 | 310 | 456 |
| Worker sessions | 150 | 1,564 | 4,337 | 6,240 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 46 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
