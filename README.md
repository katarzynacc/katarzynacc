## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 23.9h | 96.2h | 488.3h | ~6986h* |
| Interactive human attention | 6.5h | 23.6h | 103.1h | 167.2h |
| Interactive AI generation | 5.1h | 24.0h | 88.1h | 135.0h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 13.8h | 43.7h | 45.0h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 18.3h | 306.1h | 722.8h | 856.0h |
| Additive observed work | 29.9h | 366.1h | 948.0h | 1,193.4h |
| Interactive sessions | 11 | 59 | 295 | 483 |
| Worker sessions | 215 | 1,411 | 4,300 | 6,704 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 49 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
