## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 22.8h | 60.3h | 508.9h | ~7306h* |
| Interactive human attention | 2.0h | 27.1h | 101.9h | 153.5h |
| Interactive AI generation | 4.2h | 20.2h | 81.2h | 119.6h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 2.4h | 6.9h | 33.6h | 34.8h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 96.6h | 281.2h | 605.0h | 712.1h |
| Additive observed work | 104.9h | 333.9h | 812.9h | 1,011.1h |
| Interactive sessions | 14 | 72 | 300 | 446 |
| Worker sessions | 346 | 1,596 | 4,233 | 6,120 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok, stale. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 45 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
