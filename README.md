## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 141.4h | 431.8h | ~7281h* |
| Interactive human attention | 3.1h | 15.9h | 56.5h | 89.4h |
| Interactive AI generation | 3.1h | 23.7h | 171.4h | 223.5h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.8h | 15.8h | 22.7h | 25.9h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 22.1h | 101.7h | 294.8h | 1083.7h |
| Additive observed work | 29.1h | 156.8h | 543.9h | 1,420.2h |
| Interactive sessions | 1 | 11 | 60 | 105 |
| Worker sessions | 333 | 1,697 | 5,222 | 11,172 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 61 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_Model savings are modest because ~95.6% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
