## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 23.9h | 167.8h | 488.4h | ~7076h* |
| Interactive human attention | 4.7h | 30.6h | 107.2h | 186.3h |
| Interactive AI generation | 5.0h | 32.6h | 94.6h | 154.9h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 6.3h | 15.3h | 52.4h | 53.7h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 12.7h | 167.0h | 721.6h | 908.5h |
| Additive observed work | 26.1h | 241.4h | 962.4h | 1,290.0h |
| Interactive sessions | 13 | 67 | 297 | 521 |
| Worker sessions | 111 | 926 | 4,272 | 7,099 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 53 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
