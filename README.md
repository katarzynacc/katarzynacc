## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 59.7h | 563h | ~7319h* |
| Interactive human attention | 3.4h | 25.4h | 66.7h | 66.7h |
| Interactive AI generation | 11.8h | 80.5h | 185.2h | 185.2h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 1.8h | 3.5h | 8.8h | 8.8h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 6.3h | 55.9h | 273.9h | 938.3h |
| Additive observed work | 22.7h | 164.4h | 532.8h | 1,197.1h |
| Interactive sessions | 4 | 26 | 86 | 86 |
| Worker sessions | 387 | 1,726 | 5,245 | 8,794 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 48 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

| Model | Requests | Input | Output | Cache read | API Cost | Cache savings | Model savings |

_8,334.4M total tokens processed. 95.6% cache hit rate._

_$36,296.35 total saved ($24,776.68 caching + $11,519.67 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~95.6% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
