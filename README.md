## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 23.9h | 167.8h | 493.2h | ~7286h* |
| Interactive human attention | 7.1h | 18.3h | 20.3h | 134.5h |
| Interactive AI generation | 9.4h | 31.9h | 32.6h | 114.5h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 0.2h | 0.6h | 25.0h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 11.7h | 47.4h | 688.3h | 1058.9h |
| Additive observed work | 28.2h | 97.8h | 741.7h | 1,327.0h |
| Interactive sessions | 20 | 33 | 40 | 393 |
| Worker sessions | 327 | 1,398 | 4,802 | 8,956 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 64 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

_Model savings are modest because ~96.1% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
