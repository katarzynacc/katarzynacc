## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 3.7h | 63.4h | ~1,351h* |
| User AI session hours | 4.1h | 31.1h | 103.3h | 154.0h |
| AI worker hours | 44.5h | 191.2h | 523.2h | 624.1h |
| AI concurrency hours | 50.8h | 251.7h | 702.0h | 891.9h |
| Interactive sessions | 3 | 59 | 241 | 346 |
| Worker sessions | 43 | 188 | 534 | 873 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 42 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._
